				<br>
				<h3 class="h3">Our Program: Curriculum</h3>
				<p>
				The web development curriculum at DevCamp has been carefully crafted in collaboration with employers and the latest research on immersive learning. We use student feedback to improve our curriculum every three weeks, a rate of change that very few educational institutions can match.
				</p>
				<br>

				<h3 class="h3">Programming languages</h3>
				<p>
				The languages we have chosen to teach are a platform for you to learn the fundamentals of programming and more importantly, as we mentioned earlier, learning how to learn. We primarily teach Ruby and JavaScript, but by week 8 our students begin to teach themselves any language or framework they choose (Objective-C, Python, server-side JS with Node, Swift, etc.). In our final projects, we help students think critically about architecture decisions like building a JavaScript app from scratch or implementing a JavaScript framework like Angular, Ember or Backbone.
				</p>
				<br>

				<h3 class="h3">Ruby</h3>

				<p>
				Ruby is an easy language to get started with, due to some of its technical features such as being dynamically typed and interpreted. Ruby allows object-oriented design, a software pattern that provides a good reference point for other object-oriented languages like JavaScript and Java, and its use in Ruby on Rails makes it an important element in any web developer’s repertoire.

				Ruby on Rails is one of the web’s most popular frameworks, which translates to a large demand for developers with knowledge about Rails and the tools that surround it.

				Ruby on Rails allows developers to very quickly implement common features in modern web applications, such as user login, forms, or an API to support a mobile app. You’ll also work in the Sinatra framework, a lighter, simpler framework. Students are expected to understand how to build the basics by hand before they use frameworks like Rails to speed up development work.
				</p>
				<br>

				<h3 class="h3">JavaScript</h3>

				<p>				
				JavaScript is currently the only language running ubiquitously across all browsers, and is the defacto method of interacting with the browser client-side. It’s gained popularity in recent years with the rising adoption of Node.js as well as client-side frameworks like Angular, Ember and Backbone.

				Dev Bootcamp students start with the basics of interaction design through libraries like jQuery, then work into more complex ideas: object-oriented design, asynchronous requests and background jobs, interacting with third party APIs like Twitter. In later projects, students use JavaScript to tackle problems common in real applications, like graceful error handling. Some students work in JavaScript compilers such as CoffeeScript or explore JavaScript MVC frameworks.

				Like Ruby, we teach JavaScript because it’s an immediate entry into the current job market, while providing a good base to learn the fundamental concepts needed to succeed in any software language.
				</p>
				<br>

				<h3 class="h3">SQL</h3>

				<p>				
				Structured Query Language, usually called SQL, is the language used to interact with nearly all relational databases. These databases exist under the hood in nearly every online application or service. It’s possible to build web applications without knowing SQL, but we don’t recommend it. At some point, frameworks like Ruby on Rails (and its data toolkit ActiveRecord) will misbehave, and you’ll need SQL to solve the problem. You’ll get that at Dev Bootcamp early in the program.

				In later projects you’ll also get the chance to explore alternatives to relational databases, like MongoDB, Redis or Memcache. Students work with instructors to understand the advantages and tradeoffs for these approaches.
				</p>
				<br>

				<h3 class="h3">HTML and CSS</h3>

				<p>				
				These basics are covered during our remote prep program, and provide the foundations for building for the Web. HTML is a markup language that all browsers use to display content. CSS allows that content to be styled and positioned.

				Our instruction is based around the HTML 5 spec, which allows new possibilities, particularly in drawing images, organizing information, and making the Web more accessible to people with disabilities.

				We encourage students to write their CSS by hand for as long as possible, but students often explore CSS libraries such as Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation. Students may use CSS precompilers like Sass on team projects, which allows developers to better organize and maintain their CSS code.
